# Human Pose Tracking with MediaPipe

## Overview

This GitHub repository contains a Python project that utilizes the MediaPipe library for human pose tracking. The project enables real-time estimation and tracking of key body landmarks, offering a foundation for various applications such as fitness tracking, gesture recognition, and human-computer interaction.

## Features

- **Real-time Pose Estimation:** The project leverages the power of the MediaPipe library to perform real-time human pose estimation. It accurately identifies and tracks key body landmarks, including joints and body parts.

- **Multiple Pose Detection:** The system is capable of detecting and tracking multiple individuals in a given frame simultaneously. This makes it suitable for scenarios involving multiple people.

- **Flexible Integration:** The project is designed to be easily integrated into other applications. The code is well-organized, and the core functionality can be incorporated into existing projects with minimal effort.

## Dependencies

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed before running the project:

- Python 3.x
- MediaPipe library
- OpenCV

You can install the required Python packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install mediapipe opencv-python
```

## Usage
